Question1:

When computer science meets economics: Who do you truly want to become? Pick one of your favorite Nobel Prize winners (https://www.nobelprize.org/) and Turing Award winners (https://amturing.acm.org/). How do you want to contribute to the intersection of the two north stars to advance human civilizations? 

My favorite Nobel Prize winner is a famous playwright named George Bernard Shaw, whose plays continue to be performed today in theaters around the world.

My favorite Turing Awards winners are Edwin Catmull and Pat Hanrahan. They were honored for their significant contributions to three-dimensional computer graphics and their groundbreaking influence on the film industry.

I’d like to apply computer-generated imagery and motion capture technologies to reproduce the realistic classic plays into synchronously rendered virtual animations to reach a broader audience including children and teenagers.

Question2:

CS&Econ for a Better Future: How do you perceive the synergy between computer science and economics as a catalyst for steering innovation toward a brighter future? Please present a foundational assertion, followed by multiple specific instances that support your claim, including a reference to a topic discussed at the colloquium on Friday, March 22.

Computer technologies combined with economic ideas can help more enterprises accelerate product iteration and optimization in the digital age.

The development of computer science produces vast amounts of data along with analytical tools, enabling stakeholders to gain nuanced and timely insights into economic trends, consumer behavior, and market dynamics. This helps in informing better decisions in innovative product design within such a competitive environment.

For example, Tesla's self-learning systems enable remote software updates via Wi-Fi monthly, they keep iterating their products based on data to provide better user experience. With information and data gathered from over 100 million miles driven, Tesla is able to create high-resolution maps detailing speed changes and danger zones to improve their autonomous vehicle technology. These data-driven technologies empower Tesla to keep producing innovative products that outperform other vehicle companies.

Referring to Greg Sun’s sharing regarding Microsoft and their LLM Copilot, the keys to success include not only a sensitive understanding of the dynamic market and changing customers’ needs but also perseverance and passion toward iterating hardcore technologies. Embracing and learning from failures through iteration is an essential aspect of innovation.

Question3:

Beyond CS & Econ: How are aspects of human nature, like bounded rationality, and pioneering technologies, such as generative AI, reshaping the dynamics between humans and AI agents in strategic contexts? Additionally, how might this interplay be perceived and conceptualized distinctively from current models? Address this inquiry by drawing upon the literature covered in our lectures and supplementary scholarly works, ensuring to include in-text citations and a comprehensive bibliography.


Chen et al. (2023) claim that the GPT makes decisions that are mainly rational in every domain and have a higher rationality score than those made by human beings. For instance, they can complete reasoning tasks and answer math problems at the university level. Humans are more diverse and often display a higher level of heterogeneity, yet sometimes their behavior is constrained by subjective feelings and incomplete knowledge. Humans should take careful and great advantage of the rationality displayed by AI agents to be mutually supplementary in the strategic context.

Additionally, incorporating a broader range of authoritative and interdisciplinary datasets and corpus into the training of future models should be considered to mitigate the risk of potential biases. Zhou et al. (2024) have proved that models trained exclusively on financial datasets may demonstrate greater irrationality, and there exists a possibility that larger financial language models could exhibit more biases compared to smaller, more generalized models. Human interventions, such as applying Comparative Output Testing (COT), are essential in this scenario to “slow down the cognitive processes of models” and improve the logical consistency and financial acumen of the model outputs to better inform decision-making(Zhou et al., 2024).
